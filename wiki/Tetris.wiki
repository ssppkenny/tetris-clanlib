= Tetris with Clanlib =


I always wanted to create a game of Tetris. This time the game is almost ready to play with. I use Code::blocks development environment with a custom makefile on a Gentoo Linux machine. To compile the project you need to download and compile Clanlib 2.3.2. http://www.clanlib.org, check out the project and run make.
